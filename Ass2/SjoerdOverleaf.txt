\subsubsection{Propensity score adjustment}
Since our treatment variable, serum cholesterol, is continuous. We cannot perform standard propensity score matching. Instead, we can perform propensity score adjustment, following the paper \cite{imbens} (see r-companion). 
First, we fit a linear model describing the Cholesterol level in terms of the Age and Sex variable. The likelihood of a data point, i.e./ a patient, now constitutes its propensity score. These likelihoods are computed by evaluating the corresponding Gaussian distribution on the residuals. In the next step, we use a logistic regression model to estimate the effect of serum cholesterol on the binary heart diagnosis variable, adjusted for this score.

\begin{verbatim}
Call: glm(formula = HD ~ Chol +AGE + SEX, family = "binomial", 
data = data)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)         Chol          AGE          SEX  
    -1.8761       0.1996       0.5364       1.1918  

Degrees of Freedom: 296 Total (i.e. Null);  293 Residual
Null Deviance:	    351.9 
Residual Deviance: 324.5 	AIC: 332.5

Call:  glm(formula = HD ~ Chol + score, family = "binomial",
data = data)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)         Chol        score  
    -0.2726       0.1058      -2.2864  

Degrees of Freedom: 296 Total (i.e. Null);  294 Residual
Null Deviance:	    351.9 
Residual Deviance: 346.5 	AIC: 352.5

Call:  glm(formula = HD ~ Chol, family = "binomial", 
data = data)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)         Chol  
    -0.9527       0.1633  

Degrees of Freedom: 296 Total (i.e. Null);  295 Residual
Null Deviance:	    351.9 
Residual Deviance: 350.3 	AIC: 354.3
\end{verbatim}

The results of these analyses show a relatively large quantitative difference. The coefficients of logistic regression are interpreted as log odds ratios.
