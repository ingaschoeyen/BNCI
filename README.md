## The Project

Using a public dataset, we should think of a causal inference problem for this dataset and execute it using the R toolbox [fill in].

Our chosen dataset is the Heart Disease Risk Dataset.

### Research Questions

## The Repository

- Data was gathered through the UCIML repo, which has a handy python package. See `data.py` for the initial download of data, which saves the data in `data.csv`.
- Next, data is imported to R through `data_import_viz.R`.
